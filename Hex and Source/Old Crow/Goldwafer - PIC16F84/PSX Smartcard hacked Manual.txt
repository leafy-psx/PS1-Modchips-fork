Welcome to the 'Creating your own flashy keycard PSX' Tutorial!
***************************************************************


all you need:
-------------
* slightly older PSX which has one of the jpg shown boards
  (used at ebay for ca. 30 $ )

* Goldwafer smartcard (PIC 16F84)
  (findable at some digital satellite shops for 5 $ )

* usual multi chipcard programmer
  (also there, costs around 50 - 100 $ )

* smartcardcontacting-unit (cardslot)
  (disassemble some old cellphones, sat-receivers or buy it
   at electronic shops for ca. 5 $ )

* 5 different colored wires, around 40cm (20 inches)
  solder iron etc., a little hand-drill, srewdriver



Letz start:
---------------------------

Check out what cardslot contact matches which chipcard-pins,
then notice what goldwafer contact uses which colored wire
and solder the 5 wires at the correct pins.

! Often the Goldwafer is inserted that way the contacts show to the ground,
so dont get confused, orientate yourself on the Pin 5,
which has that "L form", to connect those 5 wires at the cardunit correct.

And dont solder the wires directly onto the Goldwafer. ;-)



Now disassemble your PSX carefully, manuals and how to do's you can find enough over internet.

Connect all wires as its shown on the correct Board picture for your PSX with the fitting goldwafer pins/cables.
As example if you see a C5 on the picture its simply Chipcard Pin5 (the 'L'), also the same with the remaining few pins.
If you wanna have some fun, solder a LED in series with a ca. 300 ohm resistor between Pin7 and Pin5, then you can see it funny blink at bootcode sending.


Then bundle the 5 wires and lead them outside of the PSX. After this put the platine back at its formerly place, close the PSX and screw the box.


Now put that little Goldy into your programmer, and "burn" one of those provided *.hex files from the GW_ALL.ZIP onto it. I recommend the:

Mod84_v3 Goldwafer SCEx ASCII by Truman.hex 'cause its the newest and first progged, but all 3 are working great. ;-)


If you dont have yet any smartcard programming software, simply search for all those free programs you can find on the net like: Chipcat, CardWriter or IC-Prog. If there are some settings you can control, use for OSC: XT and for WDT, PWRTE and CP always OFF!

After you had programmed your smartcard, you can made a verify to check if everythings written correctly. And thats all!


Now sit down relaxed and stick those cool little keycard into your hot slut ehm cardslot *eg* and enjoy the booting sequence of your favorite backups.

Everyone around will envy you now, and if you should have kids, they will do all you want just for getting hands on your magic keycard! *ggg*


Good luck and have Fun!
