* PSX MODEL MOD-CHIP Design
*
* Version 2.01.070910.garyOPA
*
* Based on designs by Old Crow
*
* Updated for the PIC12F629 Chip
*

 After 10 years of the original modchip design
for the PSX machines which used the older PIC
12C508, we came across a bunch of un-modded new
PS-One machines, and since we had the old source
code for the PSX modchip, and the original design
used the PIC 12C508 chip, which is hard or costly
to get these days, and there is tons of the newer
12F629 chips around these days due to the Wii-mod.

 We decided to release to the world, our quick and
dirty recode of the old Classic 4-wire mod for the
PSX using the 12C508 which was originally coded by
the famous Old Crow (Scott Rider), and updated it
to support the newer 12F629 chip.

 Included in this package is the our source code,
plus a complied HEX file for programming the 12F629,
and a bunch of install diagrams from various sources.

 (Sorry, but I can't recall the original sources for
the install diagrams to give proper credit for them).

 Remember when looking at the install diagrams that
this is a classic 4-wire modchip design, so only use
the pins marked 1 , 5 , 6 , 8 on the install diagrams.

 And on the newer PSX models (9000 and Slim designs),
only 3-wires were used with a link wire between 2 points.

 I didn't think we would ever need to due another PSX
release but here it is, if there is enough demand we
will update the other source files for the newer PSX
modchips, which has Stealth mode and anti-mod original
playing, which this classic 4-wire version is lacking,
but it is only 4 wires and were can you find original
PSX discs these days which are still in working order.

 We also recently had people asking for us in redoing
the old drivecode mod of the Gamecube over to the PIC
12F629 chip, and we might do so within a month or two.

 Have fun playing some old classic PSX games..........
